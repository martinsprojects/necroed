python source code editor written for Windows!

Note: this is my first Python program. Don't use it to edit files, there might be a bug in the application that overwrites opened files with a blank file. Just keeping it here as an example and if someone wants to use parts of it.

### Requirements

* Python 2.7
* TkInter

Should work on any OS but the GUI code probably only looks as intended on Windows.
